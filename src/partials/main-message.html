          <p>Crystal Cove offers Branson's premier luxury log cabin suites and bed and breakfast with a perfect combination of luxury and elegance amidst the serenity of the Ozark Mountains. Crystal Cove is nestled on a secluded mountainside above Table Rock Lake in Branson Missouri. Our property boasts the privacy and beauty of the Ozarks, yet we are only a short drive to Silver Dollar City and all of the shows, shopping, and dining that Branson has to offer. We invite you to escape from the whirlwind of everyday life with us here at Crystal Cove Bed and Breakfast.</p>
